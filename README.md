# Guppy-Embedded
The code that goes on the boards.

## Setup
- Just make sure you have a PicoSDK environment set up.

## Notes
- Currently I just have copied the can2040 code from KevinOConnor, I'm not sure if there is a better way to include it or if it's even necessary.
- The code is unfinished, untested, and I haven't tried compiling it yet
