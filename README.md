Home to the embedded PCB code that runs Guppy: [Palouse RoboSub](https://robosub.eecs.wsu.edu/)'s 2026 AUV for the international RoboSub competition. This code runs on the [custom circuit boards](https://github.com/PalouseRobosub/RP2350PCB) we designed and assembled in-house!

Currently, the CAN base code comes from [KevinOConnor/can2040](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/can2040).

> [!CAUTION]
> Active work in progress! The code is unfinished and untested.
